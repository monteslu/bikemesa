      <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Your voice matters!</strong> The Mesa City Council needs to hear from residents who support safe cycling infrastructure.</p>
      <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Email the council at: <a href="mailto:council@mesaaz.gov" style="color: #fde047; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline;">council@mesaaz.gov</a></strong></p>
      <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.1rem;">Tell them you support the Center Street bike lane project and that safe cycling infrastructure is vital for downtown Mesa's future.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Mesa has an incredible opportunity to transform Center Street into a safe, bike-friendly corridor that connects downtown to the Convention Center and beyond. The proposed Center Street project will create <strong>protected bike lanes</strong> from Main Street to University Drive - exactly what our community needs to make cycling safe and accessible for everyone.</p>

    <h2>What's Included</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>6.5-foot separated bike lanes</strong> with 4-foot buffers</li>
      <li><strong>Wider sidewalks</strong> with shade trees</li>
      <li><strong>Roundabout at 2nd Street</strong> for traffic calming</li>
      <li><strong>25mph speed limit</strong> reduction</li>
      <li><strong>Protected parking</strong> as a buffer between cyclists and cars</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn't just about bike infrastructure - it's about creating a downtown where families feel safe walking and cycling, where businesses thrive with more foot traffic, and where Mesa becomes a model for sustainable transportation.</p>
